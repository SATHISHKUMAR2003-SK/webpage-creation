                Family of Raja Raja Chola:
                Raja Raja Chola, the great Chola king, was born to Parantaka Sundara Chola, who established the Chola dynasty. Parantaka Sundara Chola was a renowned king who ruled from 907 to 955 AD and expanded the Chola kingdom to encompass parts of modern-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.
                
                Parantaka Sundara Chola was known for his military prowess and his campaigns against the Rashtrakuta dynasty in the north and the Pandya and Chera kingdoms in the south. He was also known for his patronage of the arts, literature, and religion. He built several temples and religious institutions and was a devout worshipper of Lord Shiva.

Aditya Karikalan was a brave and skilled warrior who led several successful military campaigns on behalf of his father. He was known for his valor and courage on the battlefield.
                
                However, Aditya Karikalan was involved in a power struggle with his younger brother, Arulmozhi Varman (Raja Raja Chola), and was eventually killed in a battle. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear, but it is believed that he was killed in a duel with Raja Raja Chola over the succession to the throne.
                
                Kundavai, the only daughter of Parantaka Sundara Chola, was a prominent figure in the Chola court and played a crucial role in shaping the history and culture of Tamil Nadu.

                Current status of Brahdeeswara temple:
                Brahadeeswara Temple, also known as the Brihadeeswara Temple or Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a Hindu temple located in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. It was built during the reign of the Chola dynasty in the 11th century CE by the emperor Raja Raja Chola I. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is considered one of the finest examples of Tamil architecture.
                
                The temple is famous for its towering Vimana, which is a term used to describe the tower above the sanctum sanctorum of a Hindu temple. The Vimana of the Brahadeeswara Temple is over 60 meters tall and is one of the tallest in the world. The dome of the Vimana is made of granite and weighs around 81.3 tonnes. It is believed that the dome was lifted into place using a ramp made of earth, and it is a testament to the engineering skills of the Chola dynasty.
                
                The temple complex also includes a Nandi Mandapam, which is a pavilion that houses a statue of Nandi, the sacred bull of Lord Shiva. The statue of Nandi is carved out of a single piece of stone and is over 6 meters long and 3.7 meters tall. The entire Nandi Mandapam is carved out of granite and features intricate carvings of various deities and scenes from Hindu mythology.
                
                The main sanctum sanctorum of the temple houses a lingam, which is a symbol of Lord Shiva. The lingam is believed to have been brought from the banks of the Narmada River and is considered one of the most sacred symbols in Hinduism. The inner walls of the sanctum sanctorum are adorned with exquisite frescoes that depict various scenes from Hindu mythology.
                
                The temple also features several other shrines and mandapams that are dedicated to various deities. The Keralantakan Shrine is dedicated to Lord Shiva’s son, Murugan, while the Subramanya Shrine is dedicated to his other son, Kartikeya. The Natya Mandapam, or Hall of Dance, features several pillars that are adorned with intricate carvings of various dance poses. The Raja Raja Mandapam is another hall that is used for various religious and cultural events.
                
                The Brahadeeswara Temple is an important pilgrimage site for Hindus and attracts thousands of visitors every year. It is also recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the greatest architectural achievements of the Chola dynasty. The temple complex is a stunning example of Dravidian architecture and is renowned for its intricate carvings, stunning frescoes, and towering Vimana.</p>
